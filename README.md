Description:
        The Tic Tac Toe game project is a classic implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        It provides a simple yet engaging gaming experience where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid,
        aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their chosen symbol (traditionally 'X' or 'O').

Key Features:

User Interface: The game features a clean and intuitive user interface designed using HTML and styled with CSS to enhance visual appeal and user experience.

Responsive Design: The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Interactive Gameplay: Players can interact with the game grid by clicking on the available cells to place their respective symbols. 
                      JavaScript handles the game logic, verifying moves, checking for a winner, and updating the display accordingly.
                      
Turn-Based Mechanism: The game enforces a turn-based mechanism, allowing each player to make one move per turn, ensuring fair gameplay.

Win Detection: The system detects winning combinations of symbols (rows, columns, and diagonals) and displays the winner once achieved.

Draw Detection: In the event of no winning combination and the grid being completely filled, the game declares a draw.

Restart Option: Players have the option to restart the game at any point, allowing for multiple rounds of gameplay without needing to refresh the page.

Visual Feedback: The game provides visual feedback for player actions, such as highlighting the selected cell and displaying winning or draw messages.

Minimalistic Design: The project aims for simplicity in design and code structure, making it easy to understand, modify, and expand for learning purposes or customization.

Overall, this Tic Tac Toe game project serves as a fun and educational exercise in web development, demonstrating the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive gaming experience.
